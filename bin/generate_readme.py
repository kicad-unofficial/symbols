print("""# Symbol Libraries

This is an unofficial collection of symbol libraries for KiCad 6.

The footprints used by these symbols are in the [footprints] repository.

[footprints]: https://github.com/kicad-unofficial/footprints

## Conventions

These symbols are intended to require no further specification once placed into
the schematic.

To that end, parts are only included if their symbol can be "fully-specified",
meaning that it uniquely identifies a specific part that can be ordered from a
supplier. Generic (non-fully-specified) symbols _are_ also provided for parts
that are available in multiple footprints.

Where appropriate, an `Octopart Query` field is added for use with the [Octopart
BOM generator].

### Automotive Qualified Parts

Automotive qualified parts (AEC-Q100, etc) include the text `automotive
qualified` in their description and are marked with a ðŸš—&nbsp; (car) icon in the
[symbol index](#symbol-index) below.

### Enclosure Symbols

Some symbols represent PCB enclosures rather than parts to be placed on the PCB.
They are marked with a ðŸ“¦&nbsp; (package) icon in the [symbol index] below.

The footprint of these symbols defines the edge cuts layer and mounting holes
for the PCB.

## Symbol Index

This is an index of the available libraries and the symbols they contain. Each
library contains symbols for a specific vendor or manufacturer.

print("""## Notes for Symbol Creators

- Name the component as the part number used for ordering, excluding packing alternatives.
- Start the description with the "general" part number (usually the one used to identify the datasheet).
- Prefer symbols that are easy to layout in schematics over symbols that match pin layouts.
- End the description with the package name, if multiple are available.
- Use a border of `0.254mm` on filled shapes
- Link directly to manufacturer's datasheet (not Mouser, for example)
- Include an [`Octopart Query` field](https://github.com/kicad-unofficial/bom/tree/main/octopart#readme), wherever possible
- For automotive qualified parts:
  - Include `automotive` and `aec` keywords
  - Include `automotive qualified` in the description
